    <div class="section">
        <h2>Background:</h2>
        <p>Rumors have reached your ears of a powerful heirloom, the Crown of Wessex, believed to bestow the wearer with the allegiance of England's most influential lords. Such an artifact could turn the tide in favor of William the Conqueror. However, it's hidden deep within the Saxon stronghold of Rochester Castle, a formidable fortress under the command of a loyal Saxon lord, Aethelred the Stubborn.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Objectives:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Gather Information</strong>: Start by visiting the local tavern in the nearby village of Strood. Here, you'll need to persuade the innkeeper to reveal the secrets of Rochester Castle's defenses and the location of the heirloom.</li>
            <li><strong>Recruit Allies</strong>: The mission's success requires more than brute force. You'll need allies. Rescue Edwin, a skilled archer, and Godric, a defector from the Saxon army, both willing to join your cause for the right price or persuasion.</li>
            <li><strong>Infiltrate Rochester Castle</strong>: Utilize stealth to enter the castle grounds, avoiding detection by the guards. Find the secret passage as hinted by the innkeeper, leading to the castle's undercroft.</li>
            <li><strong>Secure the Crown of Wessex</strong>: The heirloom is guarded in the castle's treasury, protected by puzzles and traps left by its Saxon guardians. Solve the ancient puzzles to access the treasury.</li>
            <li><strong>Escape the Castle</strong>: With the crown in hand, evade or fight your way out of the castle. Aethelred the Stubborn will not let the heirloom go easily, culminating in a confrontation with the Saxon lord.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Quest Completion:</h2>
        <p>Return the Crown of Wessex to William the Conqueror. As a reward, you will gain his favor, unlocking new missions and receiving a piece of legendary equipment, along with a substantial amount of gold.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Key Choices and Consequences:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>How you deal with Aethelred the Stubborn: Killing him will demoralize the Saxon defenders but make you a feared figure among potential Saxon allies. Convincing him to join William's cause or imprisoning him offers different rewards and alters the political landscape.</li>
            <li>The fate of the Crown of Wessex: Presenting it to William strengthens your position and the Norman conquest. Keeping the crown for yourself opens a hidden questline with high risk but potentially greater power.</li>
        </ul>
